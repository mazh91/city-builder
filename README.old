Description
===========
- The program is tested and fully functional
- The alternative materials are used for selected cubes

Compiling
=========
To compile program, browse to the main directory(CityBuilder-1.6f), open a terminal window and enter the following command:
$ make CityBuilder

Instructions are specific to Unix-based environment. If you're using windows, 
include "windows.h" to all source files, create a project in Visual Studio and import all files accordingly. 
 
Running
=======
To run program:
$ ./CityBuilder

Or use your favorite file browser. Make sure the file is set to execute, and double-click on it to run.

Transformations
===============
Use appropriate keys (t, s, r, h) to set transformation modes to the selected object.
Use arrow keys to move, scale, and rotate objects.
Use (c) to switch between cubes.
Use (+, -) to select multiple cubes.

Storing Cubes
===============
Use the appropriate keys (l, w) to restore and store cube objects.
You may remove the object file "obj", without affecting the program functionality. 

Use (q) to quit program without saving current state.

Mouse Events(beta)
==============
You may move around the selected cube by pressing down the mouse button and dragging.
Note that this functionality is inconsistent. Typically when performing this operation 
on the same cube multiple times, leads to undefined transformation behavior.  

Enable dragging boundaries by setting "enableDragBounds" to true (disabled due to occasional glitches)
